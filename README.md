# rubiks-robot

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This is a control system and GUI for a Rubik's Cube solving robot I'm making.
It is running on the Raspberry Pi.
The system uses [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) as well as the [CubeJS library](https://github.com/ldez/cubejs).
